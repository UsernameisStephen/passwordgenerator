Password Generator

Description:

With the given css and html, I created a JavaScript file that produced a simple, user-friendly random password generator. The user will be shown a clickable icon that will then show a serious of prompts that will allow the user to generate a secure password containing special characters, uppercase/lowercase letters, and numbers. The user will also be allowed to specify the password length (from 8-128 characters).
